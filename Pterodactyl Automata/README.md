**Pterodactyl Automata**
***

* I chose this mechanism because I like dinosaurs, Jurassic Park is one of my favourite movies ever</br>
* This mechanism works by rotating the crank wich activates the motion for the small spur gear. The small spur gear puts in motion the big spur gear. Then the cams are moving. 
* Due to the contact between the yoke and the cams the sliders are moving up and down. The yoke in the back is conected to the bellcranks and they move the wings.</br>
* The main components participating in the motion are the 2 spur gears and the crank</br>
* --what joint / component do you need to power, or what motion study do you need to play to see the motion</br>
* In the repository there are multiple folders: one for the canvases, one for the stl files fo each of the parts, screenshots from the printer, and f3ds to show the progress for the past 3 weeks</br>
* I used Autodesk Fusion 360 to desing and render this mechanism</br>
